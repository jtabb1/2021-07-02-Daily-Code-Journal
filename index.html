    <p>Today I worked on a presentation for one of my old 
      projects, made a silent demo of it, worked on styling changes for my current project, and worked my Amazon job for 10 hours.  </p>

    <p>I intend to go to the store and work on some project 
    features before ultimately going to bed tonight.</p>
